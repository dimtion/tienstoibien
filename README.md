# Tiens-toi bien !

Little Friday night project to force myself to keep a good position when
sitted.

This app will periodically take pictures from my webcam, and send a
notification if it infers that I'm not sitted correctly.


There is minimal dataset provided, that works on my setup. It probably needs to
be retrained if you are in a different environement.


## Quickastart

Simply launch the `run.sh` script for a quickstart
```bash
./run.sh
```

## Training

To train simply launch the program, and in different sitted position, press (t)
if you are not in a good position or (y) if you think you are in a good
position. Press (q) to quit the app.

Repeat multiple time until you think that the precision and success rate is
good enough.


**Disclamer: this app does not substitute to a health professional, if you have
any backache please consult a health professional.**
